Grade Calculation: Write a function that takes a numerical score (0-100) as an argument and returns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the standard grading scale.

Odd Numbers with while Loop: Use a while loop to print all odd numbers from 1 to 50.

Array Methods: What will the following code output?
javascript
Copy code in
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2)
console.log(doubled);

String Methods: How can you check if a string contains a specific substring? Provide an example using the string "Hello, World!".

Ob0jects: How do you add a new property to an existing object? Provide an example object and show how to add a property called age.

Functions: Write a function called sum that takes two parameters and returns their sum. What will sum(5, 10) return?

this Keyword: Explain how the this keyword behaves in a method of an object. Provide an example using an object that has a method.

Function Constructor: How do you create an object using a function constructor? Provide an example of a constructor function called Car that initializes make and model properties.

Fibonacci Function: Write a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be 5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5).


given an array, the task is to cyclically rotate the array clockwise by one time.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}
Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


For a given two-dimensional integer array/list ‘ARR’ of size (N x M), print the ‘ARR’ in a sine wave order, i.e., print the first column top to bottom, next column bottom to top, and so on.
For eg:-
The sine wave for the matrix:-
1 2
3 4
will be [1, 3, 4, 2].



Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and converts all the lowercase letters to uppercase without using any inbuilt string methods such as toUpperCase() or toLowerCase(). You can assume the input will contain only alphabetical characters.
Example:
Input: "hello"
Output: "HELLO"
Hint:
You can use ASCII values to determine the difference between lowercase and uppercase letters. In the ASCII table:
Lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') range from 97 to 122.
Uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z') range from 65 to 90.
You can use this information to convert each lowercase letter to its corresponding uppercase counterpart.
